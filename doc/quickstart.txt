Quickstart Guide: FMS AM3 Model

Abstract

AM3 (Donner et al., 2011), the atmospheric component of the GFDL coupled model CM3, was designed with an awareness of key
emerging issues in climate science, including aerosol-cloud interactions in climate and climate change, chemistry-climate
feedbacks, land and ocean carbon cycles and their interactions with climate change, and decadal prediction. It is GFDL's
first global atmospheric model to include cloud-aerosol interactions, with 20 interactive aerosol species. AM3 includes
interactive tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry (85 species). AM3 uses emissions to drive its chemistry and aerosols.
Its inclusion of stratospheric chemistry and dynamics will enable possible interactions between the stratosphere and
troposphere on interannual scales to be included in future studies of decadal predictability. Its stratosphere has
increased vertical resolution over AM2, with the uppermost level at about 1 Pascal. AM3's improved simulation of Amazon
precipitation will enhance future coupling into an earth-system model.

AM3 uses a cubed-sphere implementation of the finite-volume dynamical core. Earth's atmosphere is represented as a cube
with six rectangular faces. There is no singularity associated with the north and south poles as with the spherical
representation. Computationally, the core is highly scalable and efficient at advecting the large number of tracers
associated with AM3's chemistry and aerosols.

AM3 uses physically based aerosol activitation (Ming et al., 2006) to form cloud droplets. All cloud parameterizations
in AM2 were either replaced or augmented to include sub-grid distributions of vertical velocity required for these
activation calculations. Sub-grid distributions of vertical velocity are included in AM3's stratiform clouds
(Golaz et al., 2011); deep convection (Donner et al., 2001, and Wilcox and Donner, 2007) represented by an ensemble of
plumes with mass fluxes and vertical velocities, simple bulk microphysics, and mesoscale updrafts and downdrafts; and
shallow convection after Bretherton et al. (2004, Mon. Wea. Rev.) with buoyancy sorting, entraining plumes and vertical velocity.

4. Examine the Output

1. Acquire the Source Code and Runscripts

The Flexible Modeling System development team at GFDL uses a local implementation
of GForge to serve FMS software, located at http://fms.gfdl.noaa.gov.
In order to obtain the source code, you must register as an FMS user on our software server.
After submitting the registration form on the software server, you should receive an automatically
generated confirmation email within a few minutes. Clicking on the link in the email confirms the
creation of your account.

After your account has been created, you should log in and request access
to the FMS_AM3_Model project. Once the FMS project administrator grants you access,
you will receive a second e-mail notification. This email requires action on the part
of the project administrator and thus may take longer to arrive.
The email will contain a software access password along with instructions for
obtaining the release package, which are described below.

You may download the release package from https://fms.gfdl.noaa.gov/gf/project/FMS_AM3_Model.

Click on "Files" and then click on "am3.tar.gz" to download.
This package contains only code, scripts and a few small tools.
Due to size restrictions, the model input data must be obtained from a different site.

2. Acquire the Input Datasets

You can download the input data from GFDL's ftp server at
ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/perm/AM3/AM3_input_data.tar.gz

This file must first be unzipped. Note that the resulting tar file is large, 26GB.
Extract the files into a location where you have sufficient free space.

3. Run the Model
3.1. Functionality of the Sample Runscripts

This release includes a compile script and a run script for the AM3 model in the exp directory.
The compile script:
  * generates the mppnccombine executable, which combines individual
    atmospheric restart files from multiprocessor output into one netcdf file.
  * generates the landnccombine executable, which combines individual land
    restart files from multiprocessor output into one netcdf file.
  * compiles and links the model source code.

The run script:
    * creates a working directory where the model will be run.
    * creates or copies the required input data into the working directory.
    * runs the model.
    * combines distributed ouput and renames the output files using the timestamp.

Note that the directory paths and file paths are variables. They are initially set to
correspond to the directory structure as it exists after extraction from the tar file,
but are made variables to accommodate changes to this directory structure.

The directory path most likely to need changing is workdir.
workdir is a temporary directory where the model will run. A large amount of data
will be copied into the work directory, and output from the model is also written
to the work directory. workdir must be large enough to accommodate all of this.
The input data is approximately 20GB and model output is potentially even larger.

3.2. Portability Issues with the Sample Runscripts

If you encounter a compile error when executing the compile script, first
check whether you have correctly customized your mkmf template. The scripts use
the mkmf utility, which creates a Makefile to facilitate compilation. The mkmf
utility uses a platform-specific template for setting up system and platform
dependent parameters. Sample templates for various platforms are provided in the
bin directory. You may need to consult your system administrator to set up a
compilation template for your platform and ensure the locations for system
libraries are defined correctly. For a complete description of mkmf see mkmf.html

3.3. layout and io_layout

3.3.1. layout

  The horizontal grid of each component model is partitioned among processors
according to the setting of the namelist variable "layout". Each model has a
layout variable in its namelist.
  Consider a horizontal grid with 30 cells in one direction and 16 in the other.
(This does not have to be rectangular longitude by latitude grid, model grids can
be considered logically rectangular.) If run on 24 processors, one could set
layout=6,4  The grid would be partitioned among processors as shown below.
(Each asterisk represents a grid cell)

  The cubed_sphere atmosphere and land models treat each face of the cubed sphere
grid as a separate grid in itself. The example above would then represent one
face of the global grid. The total number of cells globally would be 30*16*6=2880
The total number of processors used would be 6*24=144
  The cubed_sphere atmosphere has one restriction: It requires at least 4 grid
cells in each direction, a minimum of 16 grid cells per processor.
  The ice and ocean models are on a tripolar grid rather than the cubed sphere grid.
In this case the layout refers to the entire globe. Therefore, layout(1)*layout(2)
must equal the total number of processors used.
  Choice of layout has no effect on the model's solution, but on some platforms the
code's performance can be affected.


3.3.2. io_layout:

The I/O efficiency of high resolution models run on a large number of processors
can be significantly impacted by the number files written. For this reason, this
code allows control over the distributed output of the diagnostic and restart files.
  io_layout is a namelist variable that controls the partitioning of multiple
processor output among files. Each component model has its own io_layout.
  Consider a model running on 24 processors with layout=6,4 as shown above.
If io_o_layout were set to 3,2 the processor output would be aggregated into
files as shown below.

  Output from a single processor cannot be divided between files.
This means that io_layout must be chosen such that layout(1) and layout(2)
are multiples of io_layout(1) and io_layout(2).
  The output file names consist of a base name with a four digit file number
appended to it. For the example above the restart files for the ice model would be:
ice_model.res.nc.0000
ice_model.res.nc.0001
ice_model.res.nc.0002
ice_model.res.nc.0003
ice_model.res.nc.0004
ice_model.res.nc.0005

  As stated above, the cubed sphere atmosphere and land models treat each face
of the global cubed sphere grid as a separate grid. From these models, one would
see output files names with both the tile and processor numbers as part of the
name. For example:
atmos_coupled.res.tile1.nc.0000
atmos_coupled.res.tile1.nc.0001
etc.
atmos_coupled.res.tile2.nc.0000
atmos_coupled.res.tile2.nc.0001
etc...... 30 files in all

  Tools are provided to combine these distributed files into files of data on
a single grid. The processor numbers are removed from the file names after combining.
Combining of restart files is done in the run script provided, but is not required.
The code has the capability of restarting with either combined or distributed
restart files.

  If io_layout is set to 1,1 then all processors write to a single file and the
file number suffix does not appear in the file name.
===================================================================================

3.4  Restarting and cold-starting

3.4.1 Restarting the model to continue a previous integration

  Restart files are written to a sub-directory, named RESTART, off the working directory.
Information about the state of the model at the point of termination is contained
in these files. Each component model and/or sub-component may have restart files.
To continue a previous integration these files are put in the INPUT directory.
They are read at initialization to restore the state of the model as it was at
termination of the previous integration.

3.4.2 Cold-starting the model

  If a component and/or sub-component does not find its restart files in the INPUT
directory then it performs a default initialization, also referred to as a cold-start.
The default initialization of each component is required to be compatible with other
model components, but otherwise is entirely at the discretion of the developer(s). 
  The atmospheric and land models typically fill the model fields with constant
values for a cold-start. The result is a model state that is very flat and far
away from anything scientifically interesting. As a result, a cold-started model
needs to be spun-up. The spin-up time can be very long. For the land model it can
be on the order of a century or more. For this reason it is recommended that the user
cold-start only the atmospheric component, by omitting only atmospheric restart files
and including all other restart files.
  A few changes to the namelist settings are needed for a cold start.
For the intrepid, a namelist file with these changes is included.
===================================================================================
3.5. Time and calendar

Control of model time and calendar a common source of confusion.
Only a couple facts need to be understood to avoid most of this confusion.
The first is how the model time and calendar are set. 

 When coupler.res does not exist:
     current_date and calendar are as specified in coupler_nml
     and the namelist setting of force_date_from_namelist is ignored.

 When coupler.res does exist and force_date_from_namelist=.true.:
     current_date and calendar are as specified in coupler_nml.

 When coupler.res does exist and force_date_from_namelist=.false.:
     current_date and calendar are read from coupler.res and
     the namelist settings of current_date and calendar are ignored.

The second is the date which appears at the top of the diag table.
This is the model initial time. It is used for two purposes.

1. It is used to define a time axis for netcdf model output, 
   the time values are since the initial time.

2. It is also used in the time interpolation of certain input data.
   Because of this, It is recommended that it always be equal to 
   the date that was used for current_date (in coupler_nml) in the
   initial run of the model and that it not change thereafter.
   That is, do not change it when restarting the model.
===================================================================================
3.6  diag_table

 The diagnostic output is controlled via the diagnostics table, which is named "diag_table".
 Documentation on the use of diag_table comes with the release package. After extraction,
 it can be found here: src/shared/diag_manager/diag_table.html
===================================================================================
3.7  data_table

 The data table includes information about external files that will
 be read by the data_override code to fill fields of specified data.
 Documentation on the use of data_table comes with the release package.
 After extraction, it can be found here: src/shared/data_override/data_override.html 
===================================================================================
3.8  field_table

 Aside from the model's required prognostic variables; velocity, pressure,
 temperature and humidity, the model may or may not have any number of additional
 prognostic variables. All of them are advected by the dynamical code, sources and
 sinks are handled by the physics code. These optional fields, referred to as tracers,
 are specified in field_table. For each tracer, the method of advection, convection,
 source and sink that are to be applied to the tracer is specified in the table.
 In essence the field_table is a powerful type of namelist.

 A more thorough description of field_table comes with the release package.
 After extraction, it can be found here: src/shared/field_manager/field_manager.html
===================================================================================
3.9  Changing the Sample Runscripts

3.9.1  Changing the length of the run and atmospheric time step

By default the scripts are set up to run only one day. The run length is controlled
by coupler_nml. The variables months and days set the run length.

3.9.2  Changing the number of processors

By default the scripts are set up to run with the MPI library, on 288 processors.
To change the number of processors, change the $npes variable at the top of the sample
runscript. The processor count must be consistent with the model layouts.

To run without the MPI library, do the following:

   1. Set the variable $npes 1 at the top of the sample runscript.
   2. Change the run command in the runscript from "aprun -n $npes ./$model_executable:t"
      to simply "./$model_executable:t".
   3. Remove the -Duse_libMPI from the mkmf line in the compile script.
   4. Remove the -lmpi from the $LIBS variable in your mkmf template.
   5. Move or remove your previous compilation directory (specified as $execdir
      in the runscript) so that all code must be recompiled.

4. Examine the output

You may download sample output data for comparison at ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/perm/AM3/sample_output.tar.gz
Note that the sample output is 6.6GB in size. Extract the files into a location where you have sufficient free space.
This output was generated on the gaea system at Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL)
The file output.tar.gz contains three directories: ascii, history and restart.
The ascii directory contains text output of the model including stdout and log messages.
The history directory contains netCDF diagnostic output, governed by your entries in
the diag_table. History and ascii files are labeled with the timestamp corresponding to
the model time at the beginning of execution. The restart directory contains files which
describe the state of the model at termination. To restart the model running from this
state, these restart files are moved to the INPUT directory to serve as the initial
conditions for your next run.
