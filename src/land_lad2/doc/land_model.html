<h3>Initialization</h3>

<ul>
   <li>Write version number to the log.
   <li>Initialize tile diagnostic selectors.
   <li>Read namelists - first the land mode namelist and then the namelists
       of each component model, calling respective function from the modules. 
       Order of the component calls is not specified, and must not be essential.
       The function reading namelists may be also doing some initialization.
   <li>Store model time steps and time.
   <li>Get the land geometry from the grid specification file, namely grid cell 
       boundaries, coordinates of grid cell centers, and grid
       cell areas (both full cell areas, and land areas). 
       Convert area units to square
       meters, assuming they are the fractions of total Earth area. 
       Initialize land state variable with obtained geometry.
   <li>Initialize tiling. Cold start or input from restart file, depending on 
       the presence of the latter. On cold start the number of tiles and their 
       properties may depend on 
       the values in the namelists.
       Currently only cold start is implemented.
   <li>Initialize land model diagnostics and send land area and land fractions
       to the diagnostic.
   <li>Initialize individual sub-models by calling functions from respective 
       modules.
   <li>Initialize boundary data - allocate storage for the boundary data 
       according to the current number of tiles, and fill the boundary data
       with the current values.
   <li>Deallocate temporary variables.
</ul>
<p>The primary reason for splitting the namelist i/o in separate routine was 
because the values of the namelist variables can determine the tiling structure,
and the structure of the individual tiles. For example, the namelist may specify
the tiling that a specific component model prefers (e.g. single-tile, multi-tile,
or uniform), and, say, a number of layers that the component model uses. 

<p>Therefore the namelists must be read before the allocation of the tiles, while
initialization of the data can only be done after the tiles were allocated.


<h3>Fast time stepping</h3>

<p> The general order of operations in <code>update_land_model_fast</code> is 
following:

<pre>
surf_step_1 -- generic name for soil, glac, and lake
snow_step_1
vegn_step_1 -- "vegn_*" routines are called only where there is vegetation
cana_step_1

land_surface_energy_balance

cana_step_2
vegn_step_2
snow_step_2
surf_step_2 -- again generic name for soil, glac, and lake

update_land_bc
</pre>

<p><code>*_step_1</code> subroutines calculate the linearized coefficients for the 
energy balance closure at the surface, and coefficients necessary to update the
state given the updated surface values. These coefficients are stored within
a sub-model tile, therefore the sub-model tiles are updated by this subroutine. It
does not, however, update prognostic variables.

<p><code>land_surface_energy_balance</code> closes the energy balance at the 
surface and calculates updated temperatures and humidities at the surface. 

<p><code>*_step_2</code> subroutines, given the updated variables at the surface,
update the state of the component models. They also calculate the contributions 
of non-linear processes (or the processes that are, for some reason, inconvenient
to treat in the implicit fashion) to the changes of temperatures and humidities.

<p><code>update_land_bc</code> calculates the surface values for the next
time step (such as albedo) and updates the boundary condition data
structure that is passed to the coupler. Note that becase
<code>*_step_2</code> subroutines calculate and apply some additional
tendencies, apart from the ones due to implicitly treated linear
processes, the interface between land and the flux exchange is different
from LaD and LM3v. Namely, in addition to passing <code>T_ca</code> and
<code>q_ca</code> land now also returns <code>dT_ca</code> and <code>dq_ca</code>
&mdash; changes in canopy air temperature and humidity due to implicitly
treated processes only.

<h3>Contents of the land restart file</h3>

<p>In lm3v, the land restart file (land.res.nc) basically contains only the 
fractions of the land covered by each tile. However, in might be better to 
store tags of each of the submodels in this file as well. 

<p>Storing them will allow to re-initialize the component from the cold start by 
simply removing corresponding component restart.
