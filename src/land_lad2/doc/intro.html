  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <h3><a name="motivation">Motivation</a></h3>
  <p>
  Land occupies only about one third of the Earth surface; however,
  traditionally land models allocate rectangular arrays to represent land
  properties and land state variables. This results, naturally, in inefficient
  memory usage since the portions of those array that happen to be over ocean
  are not used at all. Typically, this does not pose a big problem in
  relatively simple models since the number of land state variables and their
  memory footprint is small. However, with land models becoming more and more
  sophisticated the burden of dragging along unused chunks of memory can become
  serious.
  <p>
  Moreover, with introduction of non-trivial tiling structure of the land surface,
  the memory utilization in rectangular arrays grows worse, since the number of
  tiles can be significantly different in different grid cells, and therefore
  rectangular arrays waste even larger percentage of memory than they would in
  the case of uniform number of tiles.  
  <p>
  Yet additional challenge for traditional memory allocation schemes is dynamic
  tiling: some land processes, e.g. the land use, can create or consume tiles
  as the simulation goes on, and the number of tiles can grow (at least
  theoretically) indefinitely. In such circumstances, it is hard to know in
  advance how much tiles to allocate at the beginning of simulation, and
  consequently it is not easy to come up with a scheme that would allow general
  enough mechanism of dynamic tiling with traditional array memory allocation 
  scheme.
  <p>
  All of the above motivated us to break away from the concept of rectangular
  (lat, lon, tile) array as a container for state variables of the land model,
  and introduce fully dynamic tiling scheme.
  
  <h3><a name="general_design">General design</a></h3>
  <p>
  The compute domain of each processor is still a rectangular array of grid
  cells; however each grid cell is represented by a flexible set of tiles. The
  land model allocates data for tiles as needed, and there are no tiles
  allocated for the grid cells where there is no land.
  <p>
  Each tile occupies a fraction of the land part of the grid cell; the sum of
  the tile fractions in the land grid cell is 1. The number of tiles, and
  fraction of land area occupied by each tile in a grid cell can change
  dynamically, for example as a result of splitting a tile by some process, or
  merging of tiles that became essentially similar.
  <p>
  Tiles are not necessarily created structurally equal. For example, a tile may
  be a soil tile with vegetation on top, or glacier tile, or lake tile. The
  state variables and parameters are different for each of those cases, so that
  the lake tile does not have to waste memory storing information for soil, and
  vice versa. A set of tiles for any given grid cell can include tiles of
  different types. 
  <p>
  Initial tiling structure is specified using input data sets, such as
  distribution of land cover and soil cover, and a number of namelist
  parameters. Similarly, the dynamics of tiling structure is specified using
  external data sets (such as land use history) and a set of model 
  parameters.
  <p>
  The land model still expects the inputs from the flux coupler in the form of
  arrays (lon, lat, tile), and returns the data to the coupler in the same
  shape. The tile dimension of those arrays can change during the run, however: 
  in this case the land model reallocates the arrays as necessary on request 
  from flux exchange module.
  <p>
  During the time stepping, the land model iterates over all tiles in the
  compute domain of the processor and calls update procedures for each tile
  individually, providing necessary input data.
  <p>
  Naturally, such design presents problems for the operations that are by
  nature massive, that is must work on all the tiles (or all the tiles of
  specific type) at once. An example of such operation would be sending data to
  diagnostics, as implemented in FMS, or writing restart files. This code uses
  different tricks to handle those cases, including intermediate buffers for
  diagnostic data and accessor functions for restart i/o. Details of implementation
  are described in specific sections of this documentation.
