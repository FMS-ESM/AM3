<h3>Land model diagnostics</h3>

<p>The tiles of the land surface are inherently heterogeneous &mdash; that is,
each tile can be either glacier, or lake, or soil covered by vegetation, or
other kind that may emerge in the future. In this circumstances, it is more 
convenient for the land
model code to work on tile-by-tile basis, dispatching processing to respective
component models as necessary. However, this creates some difficulty with
implementation of the collective operations, such as diagnostic output, or 
restart i/o. 

<p>FMS diagnostics manager works with entire arrays of values specified on 
regular grids;
while there are provisions that allow to work with a sub-domains, there is no
flexible way to work with dynamic number of tiles. Nor this capability is
necessary in the majority of the FMS code, where the most typical data structure is
an array of real values on compute or data domain. Therefore, it is land model's
responsibility to adapt its internal data structure to the existing diagnostic
manager interface.

<p>The land model implements &quot;tiled diagnostic manager&quot; on top of the
standard FMS diagnostic manager to facilitate saving diagnostic output from 
the tiled code. All the diagnostic output eventually passes through the FMS 
diagnostic manager, but there is some additional tile-specific processing 
that goes on before the data get there. Below is a brief description of what is 
going on.

<p>When the land model registers a diagnostic field, it calls
<code>register_tiled_diag_field</code>, which returns an integer diagnostic
field id, just like <code>register_diag_field</code> does. Internally, it creates
necessary entries in the data tables and calls, possibly several times,
<code>register_diag_field</code>.

<p>Each land model tile carries a flexible diagnostic buffer, which is an
object of opaque data type defined in <code>land_tile_diag_buf.F90</code>. This
diagnostic buffer should be passed down to the subroutines as an argument if it
is desireable to send diagnostic values from inside that subroutine and the
diag buffer is not accessible otherwise. Wnen the code sends data to the
diagnostics, it passes, in addition to diagnostic field id and the data
themselves, this tile-specific diagnostic buffer.

<p>Sent data are accumulated in the diagnostic buffer for each tile; when a
significant portion of time step processing is completed the land model code
calls <code>dump_tile_diag_fields</code> which aggregates the diagnostic field
values stored in the tile buffers into grid cell values and sends those to the FMS
diagnostic manager. The following code example shows what this process looks 
like:

<pre>
! somewhere in initialization:
id_diag = register_tiled_diag_field('land', 'diag_field', (/id_lon,id_lat/), &
   time, 'sample diagnostic field', 'unitless')
....
! in the "update" land model procedure:
ce=first_elmt(lnd%tile_map)
te=tail_elmt (lnd%tile_map)
do while ( ce/=te )
   tile=>current_tile(ce)
   ....
   do something with the current tile here
   ....
   ! the following call stores diagnostic value x for current tile in the 
   ! diagnostic buffer for the tile
   call send_tile_data(id_diag, x, tile%diag)
   ....
   ! calling a subroutine that will need to send diagnostics
   call sub(...., tile%diag)
   ....
   ce=next_elmt(ce)
enddo

! this call actually gathers the stored diagnostic data and sends them to 
! diag manager as an entire field
subroutine dump_tile_diag_fields(lnd%tile_map, time)
</pre>
