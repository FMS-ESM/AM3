  <h2>Land model state and boundary condition data</h2>
  <p>
  Module <code>land_data_mod</code> 
  (<a href="../land_data.F90" type="text/plain">land_data.F90</a>) is a container for several 
  things:
  <ol>
    <li>Definition of the land model global public data.
    <li>Description of boundary conditions (<code>atmos_land_boundary_type</code> and 
      <code>land_data_type</code>).
    <li>Procedures handling allocation and deallocation of these data.
  </ol>

 <h3><a name="land_state">Land model state</a></h3>
 <p>
 The module global data is of particular interest, because it is accessible 
 to all sub-modules so that they do not need to duplicate the common
 data internally. Here is the definition of the derived type holding
 the general land information:

<pre>
type :: land_state_type
   integer        :: is,ie,js,je ! compute domain boundaries
   integer        :: ntprog      ! number of prognostic tracers
   integer        :: isphum      ! index of specific humidity in tracer table
   integer        :: ico2        ! index of carbon dioxide in tracer table
   type(time_type):: dt_fast     ! fast (physical) time step
   type(time_type):: dt_slow     ! slow time step
   type(time_type):: time        ! current time

   real, pointer  :: glon (:,:), glat (:,:) ! global grid coordinates, radian
   real, pointer  :: glonb(:,:), glatb(:,:) ! global grid vertices, radian
   real, pointer  :: gcellarea(:,:)         ! cell area, m2
   real, pointer  :: garea(:,:)             ! land area per gridcell, m2

   ! map of tiles
   type(land_tile_list_type), pointer :: tile_map(:,:)
   
   type(domain2d) :: domain ! our domain -- be last since it simplifies
                            ! debugging in totalview
end type land_state_type
</pre>

  <p>
  There is only one variable of this type, and it is public in the module
  land_data.
  <p>
  The <code>tile_map</code> is essential for the model tiling structure. This field
  holds a 2-d array of tile containers, one for each grid cell in our computing
  domain. Naturally, over ocean points the containers are empty. The tiles can
  be added and removed dynamically.

  <h3><a name="land_bc">Boundary conditions</a></h3>
  <p>
  Boundary condition data are basically defined by what the flux coupler expects 
  from the land model. They are
  the same for all land models (at least the same as current version of lm3v is
  using).

  <p><code>atmos_land_boundary_type</code> serves to pass information from
  flux coupler to the land model:
  
<pre>

   ! data passed from the coupler to the surface
   real, dimension(:,:,:), pointer :: & ! (lon, lat, tile)

        drag_q    => NULL(), &   ! product of cd_q by wind

        tr_flux => NULL(),   &   ! tracer flux, including water vapor flux
        dfdtr   => NULL()        ! derivative of the flux w.r.t. tracer surface value, 
                                 ! including evap over surface specific humidity
#else
   real, dimension(:,:,:), pointer :: & ! (lon, lat, tile)
        q_flux => NULL(),    &   ! water vapor flux
        dedt => NULL(),      &   ! its derivative w.r.t. surface temperature (assuming saturation @ surf.)
        dedq => NULL()           ! its derivative w.r.t. surface specific humidity
#endif 

   integer :: xtype             !REGRID, REDIST or DIRECT
end type atmos_land_boundary_type
</pre>

  <p><code>land_data_type</code> provides a container for passing data from
  the land model to the flux coupler. The presence of domain is historical, and
  probably it is not necessary here. Diagnostic axes are actually used in the
  <code>flux_exchange</code> for the land-only fluxes and fields; however there 
  might be a better way to pass them there.
<pre>
type :: land_data_type
   logical :: pe ! data presence indicator for stock calculations
   real, pointer, dimension(:,:,:)   :: &  ! (lon, lat, tile)
        tile_size      => NULL(),  & ! fractional coverage of cell by tile, dimensionless
        t_surf         => NULL(),  & ! ground surface temperature, degK
        t_ca           => NULL(),  & ! canopy air temperature, degK
        albedo         => NULL(),  & ! snow-adjusted land albedo
        albedo_vis_dir => NULL(),  & ! albedo for direct visible radiation
        albedo_nir_dir => NULL(),  & ! albedo for direct NIR radiation 
        albedo_vis_dif => NULL(),  & ! albedo for diffuse visible radiation 
        albedo_nir_dif => NULL(),  & ! albedo for diffuse NIR radiation
        rough_mom      => NULL(),  & ! surface roughness length for momentum, m
        rough_heat     => NULL(),  & ! roughness length for tracers and heat, m
        rough_scale    => NULL()     ! topographic scaler for momentum drag, m

#ifdef LAND_BND_TRACERS
   real, pointer, dimension(:,:,:,:)   :: &  ! (lon, lat, tile, tracer)
        tr    => NULL()              ! tracers, including canopy air specific humidity
#else
   real, pointer, dimension(:,:,:)   :: &  ! (lon, lat, tile)
        q_ca => NULL()               ! canopy air specific humidity, kg/kg
#endif

   real, pointer, dimension(:,:) :: &  ! (lon, lat)
        discharge      => NULL(),  & ! flux from surface drainage network out of land model
        discharge_snow => NULL()     ! snow analogue of discharge

   logical, pointer, dimension(:,:,:):: &
        mask => NULL()               ! true if land

   integer :: axes(2)        ! IDs of diagnostic axes
   type(domain2d) :: domain  ! our computation domain
   logical, pointer :: maskmap(:,:) 
end type land_data_type
</pre>

  <p>Allocation and deallocation of this data is straightforward; the only
  interesting detail is that the number of tiles may change dynamically as the
  model runs, and in this case so should the size of the third dimension of the
  arrays. That is why the initialization and allocation of these derived types
  was moved from <code>flux_exchange</code> into the land model, where current
  number of land tiles is readily available. A logical place to call such
  reallocation is the <code>update_bnd_*</code> routines, where boundary conditions
  are actually retrieved from internal land model data.

  <p>Subroutine <code>realloc_cplr2land</code> reallocates the data passed from
  flux coupler to the land according to the current maximum number of land
  tiles per grid cell within compute domain. Subroutine <code>realloc_land2cplr</code>
  does the same for the data passed in the opposite direction. They are used
  for initial allocation of the data as well.
  
  <p>Subroutines <code>dealloc_land2cplr</code> and <code>dealloc_cplr2land</code>
  deallocate the respective boundary condition data to free the memory; they 
  are called at the 
  end of the execution.
