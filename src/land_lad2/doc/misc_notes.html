<h2>Sharing data between different modules of a component model</h2>

<p>It's a typical situation in a component model that some data initialized in
the <code>"..._tile"</code> part must be accessible in the body of the model. 

<p>A good example is the number of layers <code>num_l</code> and the array of layer
thicknesses <code>dz</code> in, let's say, glacier component model. They are
specified through the namelist <code>glac_data_nml</code> in the
<code>glac_tile_mod</code>, since they are used in creation of tiles and
initialization of some other parameters. On the other hand, they must be
accessible in <code>glac_mod</code> since they are used in <code>glac_step_1</code> and
<code>glac_step_2</code>. 

<p>An obvious solution would be to move <code>glac_step_1</code> and
<code>glac_step_2</code> to <code>glac_tile_mod</code>, but the trouble is that these subroutines
also require access to routines defined in separate modules that depend on
<code>glac_tile_type</code> (in particular, diagnostics). While this would not be a
problem in a language with sane separation between interface and
implementation, in FORTRAN90 with its' rigid module structure it does not seem
possible without resorting to trickery through FORTRAN77-like standalone
subroutines. 

<p>There are several possible solutions to this problem:
<ul>
   <li>Make such data publicly accessible through the module interface. I don't
   like this idea because it exposes the data to the entire outside world as well.
   <li>Provide a public accessor functions to get the data. This is not as bad
   as exposing the data, but clutters the interface.
   <li>Somehow duplicate the data in the body of the model. While generally not 
   a good idea, in the case of the data that never change during a run, like in
   <code>dz</code> or <code>num_l</code> in the example above, it may be OK. 
</ul>

<p>For now, I tend to like the third solution for this kind of parameters.

<p>More specifically, since <code>read_glac_namelist</code> calls
<code>read_glac_data_namelist</code> it is only natural to pass the initialized
<code>num_l</code> and <code>dz</code> back through argument list. Still, the maximum
size of the array <code>dz</code> must be consistent in two modules. However, since
it is a hard-coded constant, it is easier to handle.


<h2>Possible future changes</h2>

<p>This is a list of possible changes to the design or implementation that are
not urgent or essential, but may be done in the future to improve the code style
and/or functionality.

<ul>
   <li>Currently some, if not all, component models access a global variable
     <code>lnd</code>, which holds the essential common land information like map 
     of tiles, domain, time steps. It may be beneficial, from the point of view 
     of visibility separation, to pass it (or only relevant information from it) 
     through the argument list where 
     necessary.
   <li>Change the order of operations so that the model works with standard
     <code>flux_exchange</code>, without having to add variables to the interface.
     Move calculation of tendencies due to nonlinear processes before calculating
     the implicit part, so that implicit vertical diffusion calculations diffuse
     the nonlinear tendencies at the same time step. Atmosphere works this way,
     calculating nonlinear tendencies before the downward pass, and diffusing 
     them immediately.
</ul>
