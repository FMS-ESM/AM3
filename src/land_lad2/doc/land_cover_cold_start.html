<h3>It's necessary to reconcile the cover data on the cold start</h3>

<p>On the cold start of the model (that is, a start  without initial
conditions) the partitioning of land cover between different tiles must be
initialized according to the external data and user preferences.  The data may
come from different sources, and may not be consistent. For example, in the
model the lake, glacier, and soil tiles are mutually exclusive, and the sum of
their fractions must be equal to 1. However, a user might want to use, say,
lake fraction data from his/her own data set, which is not necessarily
consistent with the standard soil/glacier input.

<p>Another complications arises from the fact that the land/ocean mask used by
the model is not necessarily consistent with the mask used in the input cover data.
Sometimes, the model would introduce land points where there's no data, and
sometimes the model does not have land where there is cover data. Since model
land mask can and does change as the model evolves, and, moreover, there are
several land masks used by the different configurations of the model (e.g. fv
core vs. b-grid), it would be impractical to have to change land model inputs
for each of the possible masks in use.

<h3>Order of cold-start initialization</h3>
<ol>
<li>Each of the component models reads it's own namelist. It has to be done as a first step
of the entire initialization process, because namelists can affect the
initialization of the cover maps. For example, user might prefer to use uniform
vegetation, or single-tile
vegetation (picking dominant tile in each grid cell), or full multi-tile vegetation.

<li>Each model reads its data and returns an array of the cover fractions,
taking into account its input data and user preferences provided through
namelists. Since the main program doesn't know beforehand how many tiles each
component will request, the component models allocate necessary arrays
themselves and return pointers to these arrays of fractions (see subroutine
</code>land_cover_cold_start</code>):

<pre>
  ! get the maps of fractional covers for each of the sub-models
  glac=>glac_cover_cold_start(gmask,lnd%glonb,lnd%glatb)
  lake=>lake_cover_cold_start(gmask,lnd%glonb,lnd%glatb)
  soil=>soil_cover_cold_start(gmask,lnd%glonb,lnd%glatb)
  vegn=>vegn_cover_cold_start(gmask,lnd%glonb,lnd%glatb)
</pre>
Note that the component models are given global arrays of cell boundaries and
return global cover fraction fields. Also note that the returned fractions are
fractions of the land covered by particular tiles, not the fractions of the
entire grid cell covered.

<li>Valid cover data mask is defined as a portions of the grid where sum of the
fractions of glaciers, lakes, and soils is larger than 0. For each model land
point where there is no valid data the glacier, lake, and soil cover is copied
from the nearest valid point.

<li>Valid cover data mask is redefined as a portion of the grid where sum of the
vegetation fractions is larger than 0. For each model land point where there is
no valid data, and which is not completely covered by lakes or glaciers the
vegetation cover fractions are copied from the nearest valid point.

<li>For each model land point a set of tiles is created according to the
fractions obtained on the previous steps (<code>land_cover_cold_start_0d</code>):
   <ol>
   <li>Fractions of glaciers are normalized so that their sum does not exceed 1
   <li>Fractions of lakes are normalized so that the sum of lakes and
   (normalized) glaciers does not exceed 1
   <li>Fractions of soils are normalized so that the sum of the soils,
   normalized glaciers, and normalized lakes does not exceed 1
   <li>Glacier and lake tiles are created according to their normalized fractions
   <li>Vegetated soil tiles are created so that the total fractions of
   vegetation types are proportional to those in the input vegetation cover
   data, and the total fractions of the soil types are proportional to those in
   the input soil data. The process uses random overlap assumption &mdash; that
   is, it assumes there is no preferred soil/vegetation combinations.
